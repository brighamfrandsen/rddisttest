Title: Tests for Manipulation of Discrete Running Variable
Version: 0.1.0

Description: The regression discontinuity research design rests on the key assumption that
    individuals cannot precisely choose their level of the running variable. Conventional tests on
    the validity of this assumption rely on a continuous running variable. This package provides
    users with a way to test the assumption of no manipulation when the running variable is discrete.
